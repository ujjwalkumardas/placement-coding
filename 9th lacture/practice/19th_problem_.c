/*PROBLEM DEFINATION :-  Write a C program for given two numbers N and K, our task is to subtract a number K
from N until number(N) is greater than zero, once the N becomes negative or zero then we start adding K
until that number become the original number(N).

CONSTRAINTS:- n<10^9 and k<10^3
INPUT FORMAT :- integer
OUTPUT FORMAT:-result sum of the series
SAMPLE INPUT :- N=15,K=5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:- 15 10 5 0 5 10 15
